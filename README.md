# Claude Code Artifacts

A repository for custom Claude Code entities, tools, and experimental configurations.

## Overview

This repository serves as an extension workspace for Claude Code, storing configurations, specialized tools, and experimental systems that extend Claude Code's capabilities.

## Purpose

This repository is designed to:
- Store custom Claude Code entities (agents, output styles, commands, etc.)
- Host specialized configurations that generate Claude Code environments

## Usage

Entities can be referenced in [environment configurations](environments/templates/basic-template.yaml) using local paths or URLs.

## Security Considerations

- Never commit API keys or sensitive credentials
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Review all code before sharing
- Be cautious with hook scripts and automated actions
