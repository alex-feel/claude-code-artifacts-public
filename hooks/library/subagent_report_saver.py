"""
Subagent Report Saver Hook for Claude Code.

This hook intercepts SubagentStop events and instructs the agent to save a
comprehensive work report to the context server before stopping. This ensures
all subagent work is properly documented and preserved for future reference.

The hook blocks the stop action (exit code 2) and provides detailed instructions
via stderr for the agent to create and save their work report.

Trigger: SubagentStop
Exit Codes:
  - 0: Silent pass-through (on errors or invalid events)
  - 2: Block stop and provide instructions (on valid SubagentStop)

Please complete the following before stopping:

1. Create a comprehensive Markdown report of your work results including:
   **FIRST CHECK**: If you have a specific report format defined in your own agent instructions, USE YOUR OWN FORMAT
   **ONLY IF NO SPECIFIC FORMAT EXISTS IN YOUR OWN INSTRUCTIONS**, use the following:

   ## Summary
   - Brief overview of what was accomplished

   ## Work Performed
   - Detailed list of all tasks completed

   ## Results Achieved
   - Detailed documentation, outcomes, deliverables, etc.
   - Examples (code, etc.), URIs (URLs, etc.)
   - Other references (version numbers, filenames, entity names, lines in code, etc.)
   - Any other information according to the work done

2. Save the report using `mcp__context-server__store_context` tool with these parameters:
   - thread_id: '{session_id}' (you can always re-read it from `.claude/.session_id` file in the current working directory)
   - source: 'agent'
   - text: [your complete Markdown report]
   - metadata: {{
       "agent_name": "[your agent name]",
       "task_name": "[derive it from the initial task assigned to you]",
       "completed": "[true if the task is completed in full/false if the task is not completed]"
     }}
   - tags: ["report", plus any relevant tags describing the report content]

3. After successfully saving the report, do NOT pass it to the calling party, just tell it that the task is completed.

This ensures your work is documented and preserved for future reference. Ultrathink.'''
